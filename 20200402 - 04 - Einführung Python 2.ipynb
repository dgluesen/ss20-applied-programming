    "**For the following tasks, please form teams of at least (and ideally also a maximum of) three people, whereby you determine a team lead.** *Please*, organize yourself in such a way that the previous knowledge is equally distributed in each team. Especially git/GitHub knowledge should be at least a little bit present in each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The team lead creates a repository for this mini-project on GitHub and invites the other team members as collaborators (Settings >>> Manage access >>> Invite a collaborator).\n",
    "2. In the subfolder \"modules\" of the repository of this lecture you will find a template file named \"template_l04.py\". The team lead should download it and add it to your repository. It is up to you whether you do this in a subfolder or directly on the top level.\n",
    "3. In the template, which will be a module for your project, you will find an initial structure for a dictionary and two methods. The team lead is responsible for filling the dictionary and the other two team members share the methods between themselves. (If there are more than three people in your team, more people can create separate dictionaries for other NFL divisions, thus increasing the database).\n",
    "4. Each collaborator now creates his or her own branch in git/GitHub on which he or she will work.\n",
    "5. When the development work is completed, the team lead is responsible for merging the individual results and testing. The result should be able to be integrated as a module or package into a Jupyter Notebook, where, if two teams are specified, a sentence can be displayed about which team is older."
