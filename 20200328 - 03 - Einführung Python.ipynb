    "1. Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that $a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any values of $n$ greater than 2. Write a function named ``check_fermat()`` that takes four parameters ($a$, $b$, $c$ and $n$) and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If $n$ is greater than 2 and $a^n + b^n = c^n$ the program should print, \"Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!\" Otherwise the program should print, \"No, that doesn’t work.\"\n",
    "2. What does the following function ``recurse()`` do? What happens for different values of $n$ and $s$? Write a docstring (and research upfront what this refers to in terms of functions) that explains everything someone would need to know in order to use this function (and nothing else)."
